# Prototype Pattern: Document Templates

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates the Prototype pattern through a document template management system. The system allows creating predefined document templates that can be cloned and customized for specific use cases, avoiding the overhead of creating documents from scratch.

## Problem Solved

In many business environments, organizations frequently create similar documents with standardized formats:
- Quarterly reports with consistent sections and formatting
- Project proposals with standard structure and required sections  
- Legal contracts with predefined clauses and terms

Creating these documents from scratch each time is inefficient and error-prone. The Prototype pattern provides a solution by allowing you to:
- Define template documents with pre-filled content and structure
- Clone these templates to create new instances
- Customize cloned instances without affecting the original templates
- Ensure consistency across similar document types

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **Document Interface** (`Document.java`)
   - Extends `Cloneable` to support object cloning
   - Defines common document operations (title, content, sections, author)
   - Includes `clone()` method for creating copies

2. **Concrete Document Types**
   - **ReportDocument**: Templates for business reports with metrics and analysis sections
   - **ProposalDocument**: Templates for project proposals with scope, timeline, and budget
   - **ContractDocument**: Templates for legal agreements with standard clauses

3. **DocumentRegistry** (`DocumentRegistry.java`)
   - Manages a collection of prototype documents
   - Provides methods to register, retrieve, and clone prototypes
   - Acts as a centralized template repository

### Key Features

- **Deep Cloning**: Each document type implements proper cloning to ensure independent copies
- **Template Customization**: Cloned documents can be modified without affecting original prototypes
- **Type-Specific Properties**: Each document type has specialized fields (e.g., budget in proposals, effective dates in contracts)
- **Registry Management**: Centralized access to all available document templates

## Usage Example

```java
// Set up registry with prototypes
DocumentRegistry registry = new DocumentRegistry();
registry.addPrototype("report", new ReportDocument());

// Clone and customize
Document quarterlyReport = registry.getPrototype("report");
quarterlyReport.setTitle("Q3 2024 Sales Report");
quarterlyReport.setAuthor("Sales Team");

// Original prototype remains unchanged
Document originalTemplate = registry.getPrototype("report");
// originalTemplate still has default template values
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

1. **Performance**: Cloning pre-configured objects is faster than creating from scratch
2. **Consistency**: All documents of the same type follow the same template structure
3. **Flexibility**: Each cloned instance can be independently customized
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to templates automatically affect new instances
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by sharing template structure

## Real-World Applications

- **Document Management Systems**: Template-based document creation
- **CRM Systems**: Standardized proposal and contract generation
- **Report Generation**: Consistent formatting across different report types
- **Form Management**: Pre-filled forms with customizable fields
- **Email Templates**: Marketing campaigns with personalized content

## Pattern Benefits

- **Reduced Object Creation Cost**: Cloning is often faster than instantiation
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Prototypes can be registered and modified at runtime
- **Simplified Object Creation**: Clients don't need to know complex construction logic
- **Consistency**: Ensures all instances follow the same template structure

This implementation showcases how the Prototype pattern can streamline document management workflows while maintaining flexibility and performance.
